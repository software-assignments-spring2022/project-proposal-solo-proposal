# Project Proposal

## Title 
* ReFreegerator 

## Abstract 
*  ReFreegerator is an expiration date and inventory tracking application for food ingredients in the refrigerator. Produced foods including dairy products and vegetables that are easily found in grocery stores are food commodities stored directly in the refrigerator after purchase. Consumers buy refrigerated products for various reasons such as maintaining one's diet health, yet often encounter a situation in which food products stay idle in their fridge and extreme cases forget to use them. The problem of ingredients residing in a refrigerator is that in contrast to canned goods, refrigerated products have a sell-by date, which indicates a product's extent of the edible period. The software will notify its users of refrigerated commodities' approaching expiration date and empty items that users chose to always keep in stock. By using the system, consumers can plan out their meals accordingly with foods that will go stale and purchase personal necessities vacated in their fridge. 

## Target Demographics
* The software will benefit anyone visiting grocery stores bringing refrigeration-required products or refrigeration acceptable products such as carrots to their home. 

## Features 
* Products with an expiration date marked on
    - Once the user selects the category of a product, for example, milk, egg, or butter, and its corresponding sell-by date described on the product package, the app will notify the user when the expiration date on each item is approaching with the capability to choose the number of days user wants to receive notification before the expiration date. 

* Empty inventory 
    - The app will display the user-selected items to be kept all the time on the app's home screen. Users can tap the item that is intended to use to decrease the item's count. When the count of such items goes to zero, the app will notify a user of the item's purchase reminder. 

* Edible period calculation and refrigeration necessity
    - Most refrigerated products are still consumable after their expiration date. For example, dairy products are edible for another week after their shelf life. The app will automatically detect the prolonged duration in which food products are viable to eat after the sell-by date and note the duration along with the food item for users to conveniently view. 
    - Although the majority of crops and vegetables can be refrigerated to maintain their fresh appearance and to last longer, specific crops are not recommended to go into a refrigerator such as potatoes. The app can inform the user whether a food item's recommended to be refrigerated by tapping the item's icon or searching by the name. 

## Scope 
* Developing the software is suitable for a group of 4 - 6 programmers during the semester. Some challenges along the way include obtaining valid consumption periods after which the expiration date has passed, listing out every potential food product that consumers are likely to have in their fridge, and sorting crops and vegetables that can't be stored in a fridge. Calculating the edible time after the sell-by date and tracking the inventory count are relatively trivial.
